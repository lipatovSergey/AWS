Step 1 Setting S3 bucket

Regular setup. Public access and static website hosting are disabled.
Upload index.html and images to root directory of the bucket.

Step 2 Creating [[AWS CloudFront]] distribution

All creation setting default.
After distribution is created go to:
`Distribution Name` --> `Origins` --> `Edit origin`

Choose original domain. 
In `origin access` choose OAC `Origin access control settings (recommended)`.
`Legacy access identities` is the old version of access, less recommended. 
Choose OAC from the list, it's generated by `Cloud Front` automatically. 
`Cloud Front` set updates `bucket policy` automatically. But it also can be copied from Edit origin page. Here is example of this policy
```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::test31075020/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::547555544606:distribution/E1WUHTVA1UCS5K"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<span style="background:#ff4d4f">VERY IMPORTANT!</span>
If in S3 yo uploaded to root `index.html` images and scripts. You must set `index.html` as a Default root object in distribution settings on General page of distribution, else you will get `permission denied` message all the time.
